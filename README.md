Converter Android App

With this App, you can easily:

1. Convert Dollars to Euros or Euros to Dollars.
2. Convert units of area from Feet to Meters or vice versa.
3. Convert units of distance from Miles to Kilometers or vice versa.


Please enter the unit (number) to be converted on the line below the heading.  Choose the radio button underneath to perform the conversion.  The number that is output will be in decimal format.  Instead of reading 12 for example, it may output 12.3291, which is a more exact number for conversion purposes.  

You may toggle back and forth to see the output you entered beforehand.  

All of the calculations (Distance, Area, Currency) may be used simultaneously.  After entering a unit to be converted for Distance, enter a number for Area conversion or Currency.  They all can be used simultaneously.
